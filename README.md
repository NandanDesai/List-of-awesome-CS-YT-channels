***What is this repo about?***

This repository aims at listing really good Youtube channels that require the attention of CS folks.


**Requirements for the channels to be in this list**:
1.  The channels should not focus on vlogging.
2.  The channels should not focus on unboxing, reviewing etc.
3.  The channels should be related to Computer Science.
4.  The channels should use English language in their videos.

Here, the word "focus" may seem ambigous. What I mean by it is that the channels may contain a few vlogs or unboxing videos but the main theme of their channel should be to produce Computer Science related content.

**Note**: If you think that there are other channels that produce really good Computer Science content and they need more recognition, then don't hesitate to send a pull request. If you think that some of the channels should not have place in this list, then open a new issue.
